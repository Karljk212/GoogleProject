# GoogleProject

Sorry I wsn't able to complete the project. I've linked an error video I had with finding the correct python version. Just any text editor should be able to display this code. 
I was using -visual studio code 1.35.1 (towards the end of the project)
            -Trying to use python 3.6/3.7 but could only find 2.6
            -I was working of the C drive for most of my project

Even though I did not complete the project I felt like I learned a lot throughout this week,
Sorry again,
Karl
